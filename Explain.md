This is a part of the code that moves an alien sprite horizontally across the screen. The code uses two attributes to store the alien's position: `self.x` and `self.rect.x`. The `self.x` attribute is a float value that can hold decimal values, such as 1.5 or 2.3. The `self.rect.x` attribute is an integer value that can only hold whole numbers, such as 1 or 2. The `self.rect.x` attribute is used to draw the alien on the screen, while the `self.x` attribute is used to track the alien's exact position with more precision.

Each time we update an alien's position, we add the value of `alien_speed_factor` to the `self.x` attribute. The `alien_speed_factor` is a variable that controls how fast the alien moves. For example, if the `alien_speed_factor` is 0.5, then the alien will move half a pixel to the right each time we update its position. By using the `self.x` attribute, we can keep track of the alien's exact position even if it is not a whole number.

However, since we cannot draw the alien on a fractional pixel, we need to use the `self.rect.x` attribute to draw the alien on the screen. The `self.rect.x` attribute is an integer value that rounds down the `self.x` attribute to the nearest whole number. For example, if the `self.x` attribute is 1.5, then the `self.rect.x` attribute will be 1. If the `self.x` attribute is 2.3, then the `self.rect.x` attribute will be 2. We use the value of `self.x` to update the value of `self.rect.x`, so that the alien's rect matches its exact position as closely as possible.
